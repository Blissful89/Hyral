# DruxtRouter
`DruxtRouter` is a small package provided by the [Druxt](https://router.druxtjs.org/) package. It is used to watch for the routes made available by Drupal using the `decoupled-router` module. This module is not possible to use with Hyral because it does not follow any standard.

### **Future**
In the future this package will be removed as soon as the Drupal routes are available via JSON:API or any other standard.
